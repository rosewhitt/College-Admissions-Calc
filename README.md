DISCLAIMER: This is NOT the program that I, Rose Whitt, submitted to college board for my AP Computer Science Principles
Create Task (final exam), nor was it ever going to be.

This program was written in the coding language Javascript.
The purpose of this program is to compare two students likelihood of admittance to a college of their choice.
The program takes in each studentâ€™s SAT score and GPA to calculate their individual admittance based on the selected school
and then compares the likelihood of admittance of one student to the other.
